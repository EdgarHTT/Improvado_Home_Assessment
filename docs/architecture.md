# System Overview
## Pipeline
Synthetic Data Generation -> Data Warehouse (CSV Star Schema) -> Power BI Semantic Model -> Dashboard

# Components
## Data Generation
Synthetic data is generated by running a python script. Various parameters can be controlled from the config.yaml file.

## Storage Layer
Data is stored as processed CSV files within the processed data folder. Since the dataset is synthetically generated, the pipeline writes directly to the processed layer.

## Data Model
The data model follows a star schema. The central fact table contains metrics while the different dimensions contain descriptive attributes. This design simplifies query logic, optimizing speed and performance. Business metrics are defined within Power BI using DAX measures for dynamic interactivity and semantic consistency.

## Visualization
The dashboard is served within the Power BI. A preview image can be seen in exports.

# Data Flow
1. YAML config defines campaign parameters
2. Python script generates synthetic data
3. Data stored as dimensional model
4. Power BI consumes fact table and dimensions
